//!2- What is TypeScript & Why Should you use it?
//! What is Typescript:
// => TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types. Itâ€™s a superset of JS that compiles to
// building up on JavaScript. It's not a brand new language, instead it takes the JavaScript language and adds new features and advantages to it.
// It makes writing JavaScript code easier and more powerful, you could say.

//! But, we have one huge disadvantage.
// TypeScript can't be executed by JavaScript environments like the browser. Browsers can't execute TypeScript,
// and for example, Node.js also can't execute TypeScript,
// so the environments where we can execute JavaScript don't support TypeScript.

//! What's the idea behind TypeScript then? It's a better version of JavaScript and we can't use it?
// TypeScript is a programming language, but it's also a tool. It's a powerful compiler which you run over your code
// to compile your typescript code to JavaScript.So, what you get as a result when writing code in TypeScript is JavaScript.
// But you didn't write that JavaScript code, you wrote TypeScript code with all the new features and all the advantages,
// and you get normal JavaScript code.

//! How can TypeScript add new features if what you get in the end is regular JavaScript?
// And the answer is, the TypeScript compiler compiles these new features to JavaScript workarounds, so in the end it might give you a nicer syntax,
// an easier way of doing something, and it will then compile that nicer, easier way to a more complex JavaScript snippet,
// which you would have to write otherwise. So it's not magic, of course it can't add what's not possible at all
// in the JavaScript language, but it can add new features that simply are easier to use, nicer syntax
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 4- Installing & using Typescript
//! Example:
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;
const input2 = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;

{
  function add1(num1: number, num2: number) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  button?.addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log(add1(+input1.value, +input2.value));
  });
}

//! tsc fileName => compile typescript file to javascript

// If i select element from dom Typescript can't know if this will really work maybe will be null
// So could let typescript know that we are sure that we will get an element by adding an exclamation mark !
// Now in addition, I also know it will always be an input element. So we can use as HTMLInputElement, (! as HTMLInputElement)
// a syntax called typecasting which I will also explain in greater detail later, to let TypeScript know which type of element this will be.

//! This instead of i check if funded input element do this and else do this
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 5- TypeScript Advantages - Overview
//! TypeScript adds:
// 1- Types
// 2- Next-gen javascript features (compiled down for older browsers)
// 3- Non-javascript features like interfaces or generics
// 4- Meta-Programming features like decorators
// 5- Rich configuration options
// 6- Modern tooling that helps even in non-TypeScript projects
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 11- Using Types
//! Core Types:
//  number => 1, 5.3, -10 => All numbers, nod differentiation between integers or floats
// string => 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi` => All text values
// boolean => true, false => Just these two, no "truthy", or "falsy" values

//! NOTE => Typescript's type system only helps you during development (i.e before the code gets compiles)
// It doesn't change JavaScript to work differently at runtime, because browsers have no built-in Typescript support.
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 12- Typescript types vs Javascript types
// The key difference is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development)
// Sometimes it can be useful to get the type at runtime. But sometimes, like in this example, it's way better to get it during development.
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 14- Working with Numbers, Strings & Booleans
//! Example:

{
  function add2(n1: number, n2: number, showResult: boolean, phrase: string) {
    // if (typeof n1 !== 'number' || typeof n2 !== 'number') {
    //   throw new Error('Incorrect input!');
    // }
    const result = n1 + n2;
    if (showResult) {
      console.log(phrase + result);
    } else {
      return result;
    }
  }

  let num1 = 10; // 5.0
  const num2 = 2.8;
  const printResult = true;
  const resultPhrase = "Result is: ";
  add2(num1, num2, printResult, resultPhrase);
}
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 15- Type Assignment & Type Inference
//! Type inference:
// it a built in feature in typescript TypeScript will try to infer the type for you, if you don't set it explicitly.

//! Note => we don't need to write the type of const variable Because you'll not be able to assign a new number, or a new value to a const value anyways.

// and if you hover on the const variable the IDE doesn't write type of this variable
//is a built-in feature in typescript TypeScript will try to infer the type for you, if you don't set it explicitly.

//! Note => We don't need to write the type of const variable Because you'll not be able to assign a new number, or a new value to a const value anyways.

// and if you hover on the const variable the IDE doesn't write the type of this variable
// but in var or let variable when we assign value in this variables IDE write type of this variables implicitly
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 16- Object Types:
// const person: {
//   name: string;
//   age: number;
// } = {
const person = {
  name: "Yahia",
  age: 25,
};

console.log(person.name);

// Of course object types can also be created for nested objects.

//! Let's say you have this JavaScript object:

const product = {
  id: "abc1",
  price: 12.99,
  tags: ["great-offer", "hot-and-new"],
  details: {
    title: "Red Carpet",
    description: "A great carpet - almost brand-new!",
  },
};
// This would be the type of such an object:

// {
//   id: string;
//   price: number;
//   tags: string[];
//   details: {
//     title: string;
//     description: string;
//   }
// }
//   id: 'abc1',
//   price: 12.99,
//   tags: ['great-offer', 'hot-and-new'],
//   details: {
//     title: 'Red Carpet',
//     description: 'A great carpet - almost brand-new!'
//   }
// }
// This would be the type of such an object:

// {
//   id: string;
//   price: number;
//   tags: string[];
//   details: {
//     title: string;
//     description: string;
//   }
// }
// So you have an object type in an object type so to say.
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 17- Arrays Types:

// const person2: {
//   name: string;
//   age: number;
// } = {
const person2 = {
  name: "Yahia",
  age: 25,
  hobbies: ["Sports", "Cooking"],
};

let favoriteActivities: string[];
favoriteActivities = ["Sports"];

console.log(person2.name);

for (const hobby of person2.hobbies) {
  console.log(hobby.toUpperCase());
  // So hobby, on the upper hand, is correctly identified as being a string, because since we go through an array of strings, well the individual values have to be just strings.
  // console.log(hobby.map()); // !!! ERROR !!! The map method is available on arrays, but not on strings.
}
//! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//! 18- Working with Tuples
// Tuples are basically fixed-length arrays with fixed types. (but we can add and using push and pop)
// Push and pop actually is an exception which is allowed in tuples So unfortunately TypeScript can't catch this error,
// but at least it ensures that we're not assigning a wrong value here, and outside of push

// But you can access elements based on their index and you can also access multiple elements in a row.
type Coordinates = [number, number]; //! Tuple Type Definition Syntax
let coordinates: Coordinates = [10, 20]; //! Tuple Type Definition Syntax
coordinates[0] += 3; //! Index Access Operator

//! Example

const person3: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  hobbies: string[];
  role: [number, string]; //! Tuple Type Definition Syntax
} = {
  // const person2 = {
  name: "Yahia",
  age: 25,
  hobbies: ["Sports", "Cooking"],
  role: [2, "author"], //! Tuple Type Definition Syntax
};

// if you have a scenario where you need exactly X amount of values in an array and  you know the type of each value in advance,
// then you might want to consider a tuple instead of an array to get even more strictness into your app to be even clearer about the type of data
// you're working with and the type of data you're expecting.
